# dataset
This is the initial dataset created for our bot and used by it.

I've decided that we don't really need a category of "everything else"; an object in the image either is waste of some recognisable type with high probablity or it isn't (belongs to all the categories with comparable low probablities) -- and that's when it's "something else".
So, the `stupid_photo` folder was deleted.
